# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

At first I have created the brief site with some photos (from google photos) and my photo at the main page. Then I've experimented with the features of scss and others according to the assignment

The original folder is project0, the folder with my site is subfolder pset0 as I didn't want to overwrite index.html
